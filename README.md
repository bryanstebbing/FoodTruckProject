# FoodTruckProject

# Overview 
In this assignment, we were tasked to create a program which would take in up to 5 food trucks. We had to sotre the name, the type of food truck, and an associated rating in an array. Then we had to create a menu which gave the user 4 choices. 1 would list all of the food trucks the user input and display the name, type, and ratings. 2 would take the average of all the ratings and calculate the average. 3 would tell the user which of the food trucks was rated the highest. 4 exited the program. 

# Technologies Used
Java, Object Oriented Programming, Eclipse, Sublime Text Editor, Terminal, Slack, Git, GitHub. 

# Lessons Learned
This lesson helped to clarify more about how to create an array and store data from a seperate class. It also helped to show how important the order of code is when writing the program. By moving things around and deleting ancillary lines, I was able to make a more efficient use of the workspace and make the program more readable.
